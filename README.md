## About

This is a custom component the retrieves' data from the
Toyota MyT API and makes them available in Home Assistant as sensors.
As there is no official API from Toyota, I will try my best to keep
it working but there are no promises.

## Features

Only Europe is supported right now. If you want to help add other regions, please open an issue over at [`mytoyota`](https://github.com/DurgNomis-drol/mytoyota).

This component will set up the following platforms:

| Platform         | Sample sensor                 | Description                       |
| ---------------- | ----------------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| `sensor`         | `sensor.aygo`                 | Static data about your car        |
| `sensor`         | `sensor.aygo_odometer`        | Odometer information              |
| `sensor`         | `sensor.aygo_fuel_tank`       | Fuel tank information             |
| `sensor`         | `sensor.aygo_starter_battery` | Starter battery health            |
| `device_tracker` | `device_tracker.aygo`         | Shows you last parked information |

**Sensors displaying statistical information are coming soon...**

## Getting started

### Prerequisites

Use Home Assistant build 2021.3 or above.

If you can confirm that it is working as advertised on older version please open a PR.

**Note: It is _only_ tested against latest, but should work on older versions too.**

**Note: Future updates may change which version are required.**

### Manual Installation

1. Open the directory with your Home Assistant configuration (where you find `configuration.yaml`,
   usually `~/.homeassistant/`).
2. If you do not have a `custom_components` directory there, you need to create it.

#### Git clone method

This is a preferred method of manual installation, because it allows you to keep the `git` functionality,
allowing you to manually install updates just by running `git pull origin master` from the created directory.

Now you can clone the repository somewhere else and symlink it to Home Assistant like so:

1. Clone the repo.

```shell
git clone https://github.com/DurgNomis-drol/ha_toyota.git
```

2. Create the symlink to `toyota` in the configuration directory.
   If you have non standard directory for configuration, use it instead.

```shell
ln -s ha_toyota/custom_components/toyota ~/.homeassistant/custom_components/toyota
```

#### Copy method

1. Download [ZIP](https://github.com/DurgNomis-drol/ha_toyota/archive/master.zip) with the code.
2. Unpack it.
3. Copy the `custom_components/toyota/` from the unpacked archive to `custom_components`
   in your Home Assistant configuration directory.

### Integration Setup

- Browse to your Home Assistant instance.
- In the sidebar click on [Configuration](https://my.home-assistant.io/redirect/config).
- From the configuration menu select: [Integrations](https://my.home-assistant.io/redirect/integrations).
- In the bottom right, click on the [Add Integration](https://my.home-assistant.io/redirect/config_flow_start?domain=toyota) button.
- From the list, search and select “Toyota Connected Services”.
- Follow the instruction on screen to complete the set up.
- After completing, the Toyota Connected Services integration will be immediately available for use.
